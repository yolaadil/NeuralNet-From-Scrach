# ðŸ§  Building a Neural Network From Scratch (Using NumPy)

This notebook demonstrates how to build a simple **feedforward neural network** from scratch using only NumPy â€” no deep learning frameworks.

We'll cover:
1. The intuition behind neural networks  
2. Implementing forward and backward propagation manually  
3. Training on the Iris dataset  
4. Visualizing loss and accuracy

By the end, youâ€™ll understand what happens *under the hood* of frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
