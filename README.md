# 🧠 Neural Networks From Scratch (Educational Project)

This project builds a **feedforward neural network using only NumPy** — no PyTorch, no TensorFlow — to understand the *core mechanics* behind deep learning.  

It’s designed as an educational project where you’ll see:
- How forward and backward propagation work step-by-step  
- How gradients update weights  
- How activation and loss functions interact  
- How accuracy improves during training

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. Implement neural networks manually  
2. Understand how gradients are computed  
3. Visualize training loss and decision boundaries  
4. Prepare for frameworks like PyTorch & TensorFlow
